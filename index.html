        <h2>Understanding the Basics of CSS</h2>

        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style the content of a webpage. It allows you to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to your HTML elements. Understanding CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing web pages that provide a great user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>The Box Model</h3>

        <p>
          The CSS Box Model is one of the core concepts in CSS. Every HTML element on the page is considered as a box, and the Box Model describes how these boxes are wrapped around your content. The model consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin. Properly understanding and manipulating the Box Model is essential for creating well-structured layouts.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, you can add padding to give space inside an element, or use margins to create space outside an element. Borders can be added to define the edges of an element, and content is the actual material displayed inside.
        </p>

        <h3>Flexbox Layout</h3>

        <p>
          Flexbox is a powerful layout module in CSS that allows for efficient alignment, distribution, and sizing of items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. By using Flexbox, you can easily create complex layouts that are responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, by setting `display: flex;` on a container, you can align its child elements horizontally or vertically, distribute space between them, or even control their individual widths and heights relative to one another. This makes Flexbox an ideal tool for creating flexible and modern web layouts.
